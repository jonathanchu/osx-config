OS X specific configuration.

**PLEASE NOTE**

This repo has been moved to
[dotfiles](https://github.com/jonathanchu/dotfiles).

I used to work on both OS X and Ubuntu, so having a separate
`dotfiles` repo (for both OS X and Ubuntu, any *nix system) and a
separate `osx-config` was useful to reduce the amount of repeated
code. This is no longer needed. Everything can be found in my
[dotfiles](https://github.com/jonathanchu/dotfiles) repo.
